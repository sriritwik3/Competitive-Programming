Pre processing takes O(nlogn) time in any sparse trees.
But querying happens in O(1) only if the algebraic function is idempotent.
else it takes O(logn) time for each query.
There are something called Disjoint sparse trees which have O(1) for query even for associative functions.

even sqrt tree would do this.
